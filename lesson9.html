	<h3>Themes</h3>
	</header>
		<p>The series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism.[8][9] George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters.[10] Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre.[11][12] Benioff said, <footer>"George brought a measure of harsh realism to high fantasy. He introduced gray tones into a black-and-white universe."</footer></p>

	<h3>Inspiration and derivation</h3>
	</header>
		<p>The novels and their adaptations base aspects of their settings, characters, and plot on events in European history.[18] A principal inspiration for the novels is the English Wars of the Roses[19] (1455–85) between the houses of Lancaster and York, reflected in Martin's houses of Lannister and Stark. Most of Westeros is reminiscent of high medieval western Europe, from lands and cultures,[20] to the palace intrigue, castles, and knightly tournaments. The scheming Cersei evokes Isabella, the "she-wolf of France" (1295–1358);[18] Isabella and her family (particularly as portrayed in Maurice Druon's historical-novel series, The Accursed Kings) inspired Martin.[21] Other historical antecedents of series elements include Hadrian's Wall (which becomes Martin's Wall), the legend of Atlantis (ancient Valyria), Byzantine Greek fire ("wildfire"), Damascus steel (Valyrian steel), the Colossus of Rhodes (the Titan of Braavos), Ancient Egypt (Slaver's Bay), the Crusades (the Faith Militant), Icelandic sagas of the Viking Age (the Ironborn), the Mongol hordes (the Dothraki), the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), and the Italian Renaissance (c. 1400–1500).<footer> The series' popularity has been attributed, in part, to Martin's skill at fusing these elements into a seamless, credible version of alternate history
